# Grunt.js

Kickoff has support for Grunt, the Javascript task runner.

## Setup

Setting up Kickoff to use Grunt is extremely simple, follow these simple steps.

### Step 1 - Install Node
Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)

### Step 2 - Install the Grunt CLI
In order to get started, you'll want to install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally. You may need to use sudo (for OSX, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.

Run `npm install -g grunt-cli`. This will put the grunt command in your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

### Step 3 - Install Sass
Make sure you have Ruby installed, then run `gem install sass` (or possibly `sudo gem install sass`) - you can also install the pre-release version of Sass using `gem install sass --pre`. This will install it globally on your machine so Grunt has access to it.

### Step 4 - Install LiveReload browser extension
In order to have your browser's styles refresh when a Sass file is modified you will need to install the [LiveReload browser extension](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) (there are versions for Chrome, Safari and Firefox). 

### Step 5 - Checkout Kickoff
Checkout the latest version of Kickoff there using `git clone https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff.git ProjectName`

### Step 6 - Install Node dependencies
Grunt will not work without having installed it's dependencies. Kickoff's [package.json](https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/blob/master/package.json#L23) uses a few essential Grunt plugins to operate. To install them, `cd` into the project directory, then run `npm install` which will add a new folder called `node_modules` with all the dependencies.

### Step 7 - Run Grunt
Out of the box, Kickoff is setup to use 3 Grunt tasks, but many more can be used options can be used.

Running `grunt` in the command line will do a one-time build using the default setup.

Running `grunt watch` will watch your working directory for any changes and build, compile or run any task that related to that file type. For example, editing a `.scss` file will effectively run the `grunt sass:dev` sub-task which compiles the sass to css. Changing any javascript will effectively run the `grunt uglify` task. 

#### Grunt is now setup!

## Next steps:
### Javascript
By default Kickoff minifies, concatinates and creates a [Source Map](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) for all javascript files included in the project.

To choose which javascript files you want to include, just edit the `jsFileList` array at the beginning of the file. Files in this array should be organised in the order that you need them to be run.

### CSS / SCSS
There are two main `.scss` files that get compiled by Grunt: `scss/kickoff.scss` and `scss/kickoff-old-ie.scss`. These are compiled to `css/kickoff.css` and `css/kickoff-old-ie.css`. If you need to add or amend this list, change the `dev` and `deploy` subtasks in the Gruntfile (around [line 30](https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L32)).
