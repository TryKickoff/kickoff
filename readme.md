### Features

* Built in a mobile-first, responsive philosophy *(but can easily be used for fixed sites as well)*
* Sass compilation uses autoprefixer to dynamically add vendor prefixes so you don't even have to think about it
* Sass mixins for many CSS3 features including gradients, REMs with fallbacks
* Starter content styles, including clean typography, lists, tables, etc
* Starter form element styles: stacked on small-screen to 2-column (if you choose) at the breakpoint of your choice
* Grunt used extensively to ease common development bottlenecks
 * Sass compilation using [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass)
 * Concatenation and minification of JS files with and [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
 * Simple server using [grunt-contrib-connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect)


### Browser support

## Demos and documentation
Please visit [tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/](http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/) all demos and documentation for Kickoff.

## Want to use Grunt?
* Install Node from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)
* Install Grunt CLI - `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Install Sass globally - `sudo gem install sass --pre`. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) v2 is needed. Update using [rvm](http://rvm.io/), [brew](http://brew.sh) (if you use a Mac) or from [ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) then install the packages below
* Navigate (`cd`) to your project directory and run `npm install` which will install all Grunt's dependencies
* Run `grunt watch` or `grunt serve` (if you want to create a simple local server) to watch for changes and compile Sass/Javascript

When using Grunt with Kickoff, source maps are created for both the Javascript and Sass. Javascript is compiled to the `/js/dist` and Sass is compiled to the '/css' folder.

## Using Git?
Kickoff's [.gitignore](https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/blob/master/.gitignore#L30) file ignores the `/dist` folder by default. You will want to uncomment this line if you are **not** compiling these on the server.

## Yeoman generator
There is also a Yeoman generator for Kickoff, visit [tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/docs/yeoman.html](http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/docs/yeoman.html) for more info.
