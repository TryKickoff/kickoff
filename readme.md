### Features
* Built in a mobile-first, responsive philosophy *(but can easily be used for fixed sites as well)*
* Sass compilation uses [autoprefixer]() to dynamically add vendor prefixes so you don't even have to think about it. We still have many Sass mixins for many CSS3 features including gradients, REMs with fallbacks
* Starter content styles, including clean typography, lists, tables, etc
* Starter form element styles: stacked on small-screen to 2-column (if you choose) at the breakpoint of your choice
* Grunt used extensively to ease common development bottlenecks
 * Sass compilation using [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass) although [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) can be used, but there are still some bugs; it is far quicker though..
 * Concatenation and minification of JS files with and [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
 * Simple server using [grunt-contrib-connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect)
 * SVG Icon generation using [grunticon](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon)
